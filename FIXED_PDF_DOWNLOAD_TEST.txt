FIXED PDF DOWNLOAD ISSUE - TEST INSTRUCTIONS
============================================

The PDF download issue has been resolved! Here's how to test:

🌐 STEP 1: Open the Application
-------------------------------
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:8081/document-translator

🔧 STEP 2: Test Translation (REQUIRED FIRST)
--------------------------------------------
1. In the "Source Text" box, enter: "Hello world! This is a test document for translation."
2. Set Source Language: English
3. Set Target Language: Tamil (or Sinhala)
4. Click "Translate Document"
5. Wait for translation to complete

📁 STEP 3: Test PDF Download (THE FIX)
-------------------------------------
1. After translation completes, scroll down to "Download Translation"
2. Select format: PDF
3. Click "Download" button
4. A PDF file should download immediately
5. Open the PDF file - it should open WITHOUT errors!

✅ EXPECTED RESULTS:
- PDF opens successfully (no "Failed to load PDF document" error)
- PDF contains translated text in proper Tamil/Sinhala script
- PDF has professional formatting with header, content, and footer

🧪 ADDITIONAL TESTS:
-------------------
- Try DOC format (downloads as RTF file)
- Try TXT format (should still work)
- Test with longer text to verify chunking works

🚨 IF PROBLEMS PERSIST:
----------------------
1. Open browser console (F12 > Console)
2. Look for any red error messages
3. Check Downloads folder for files
4. Verify both servers are running:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8081
   - Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
-----------------
- ✅ Added proper PDF generation library (DomPDF)
- ✅ Created real PDF files instead of fake .pdf text files
- ✅ Added Unicode font support for Tamil/Sinhala text
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint routing issues
- ✅ Updated frontend to use correct backend URLs
